PROBLEMS & LEARNINGS

> I spent at least 2 hours trying to get a right-side vertical nav but I couldn't get it to play nice with my page header so I abandonded.
> I also spent more than a reasonable amount of time trying to get my horizontal nav to be sticky - finally got there after reading I was likely missing an explicit 'top' position set.
> Struggled a lot with page layout and parent elements interfering - finally did get a small flexbox container working with image gallery but I definitely need to work on layout and how to get images and text to work together.
