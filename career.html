                <p>I have been with Liberty since 2010 and was my first corporate gig after graduating
                    college. I started with an entry-level HR role and navigated my way into the tech
                    space soon after in an L1-type support role. I was a liberal arts undergrad so I've
                    had my work cut out for me transitioning to the IT side.

                <p>I have worked adjacent to development teams, in some capacity, for close to 10 years at
                    Liberty Mutual. I’ve worked with a number of enterprise applications in various Systems
                    Analyst and Configuration Engineer roles. Most recently, I’ve been embedded with developers
                    as an Agile team member working as a Principal Configuration Engineer. My job responsibilities
                    have required me to quickly learn and become proficient in supporting SaaS and custom-
                    built/internal applications while providing me considerable exposure to tools and concepts
                    used in the software development ecosystem.
