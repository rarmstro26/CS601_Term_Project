                <p>Welcome to my portfolio site where I'll tell you a little bit about myself, my professional 
                    experience, and what I'm working on as I build my developer skillset. Have a look around!

                <p><b>The idea of coding...</b>
                </p>
                <p>The idea of coding/programming/software didnâ€™t come to me early. I wasnâ€™t seeking out Leetcode problems
                     and posting solutions to Stack Overflow as a middle-schooler. My first real-exposure was building a 
                     very basic calculator in Visual Basic during an intro class they offered at my highschool - I didnâ€™t 
                     really think about it again until my professional career. I graduated college with a liberal arts degree 
                     - Psychology - I was drawn to the idea of understanding myself (and others) better. Maybe grad school to 
                     work towards going into therapy. However, like it does for many, graduation pushed me towards a more 
                     practical path and I realized my heart wasnâ€™t really in it to pursue more school. </p>
                <p>As each role in my tech career has taken me closer to the work developers/software engineers
                    engage with, my interest in their work and the tangible solutions they can create has grown
                    immensely. My undergrad liberal arts education provided me the opportunity to develop
                    strong analytical and communication skills, but I am missing the formal logic/math/technical
                    education that will allow me to pursue my professional interests in development. And that finds me 
                    back in school over a decade later! </p>
